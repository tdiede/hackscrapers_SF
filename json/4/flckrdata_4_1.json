Oh well, the ludicrous things we do to get a good picture!\n\n555 California Street, formerly Bank of America Center, is a 52-story, 779 ft (237.4 m) skyscraper in San Francisco, California. It is the second tallest building in the city and a focal point of the Financial District. Completed in 1969, the tower served as the world headquarters of Bank of America until the 1998 merger with NationsBank, when company moved its headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nFloor count         52\nFloor area1,500,000 sq ft \nElevators38\n\nThe skyscraper incorporates thousands of bay windows thanks to its unique design, meant to improve the rental value and to symbolize the bay windows common in San Francisco residential real estate. \n\nAt the north foot of the skyscraper is a large plaza named in honor of Bank of America founder A.P. Giannini that is often shaded during the day, leading to it being criticized as cold and windswept by many.\n\nWithin the plaza is the 200-ton black Swedish granite sculpture &quot;Transcendence&quot; by Masayuki Nagare that, while resembling a liver, is locally and derisively known as the &quot;Banker's Heart.&quot; \n\nNearly the entire block\u2014the skyscraper, the banking hall, the plaza, the stairways, and the sidewalks\u2014is clad in costly polished or rough carnelian granite. An exclusive restaurant, the &quot;Carnelian Room&quot;, is located on the 52nd floor. The elevator to this restaurant is one of the few publicly accessible high-speed elevators in San Francisco. Due in large part to the late\u20132000s economic recession, however, the restaurant closed at midnight New Year's Eve, 2009.[5]\n\nIn 1971, 555 California Street, then just two years old, was featured at the beginning of the film Dirty Harry. It was from the roof of the building that the killer shoots his victim in the pool atop what is currently the Hilton Financial District hotel on Kearny Street. The film shows wide panoramic views of San Francisco taken from the roof of the building.\n\nIn 1974, 555 California Street was again used extensively for filming of a box-office hit, this time The Towering Inferno, in which the outside plaza substituted for the film's fictional skyscraper, the infamous Glass Tower.\n\nTogether with the Transamerica Pyramid, 555 California Street is evidence of the direction San Francisco's downtown was moving during the 1960s before numerous campaigns against high-rise buildings in the 1970s and 1980s forced development to move south of Market Street.\n\nReference: Wikipedia."}, "tags": "sanfrancisco flag bankofamerica canon1740f4l 555californiastreet", "farm": 5, "width_m": "500", "height_m": "314", "datetakenunknown": 0, "datetakengranularity": "0", "url_s": "https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4095/4876657508_333bf4138e_m.jpg", "longitude": 0, "server": "4095", "url_m": "https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4095/4876657508_333bf4138e.jpg", "context": 0, "height_s": "151", "width_s": "240"}, {"ispublic": 1, "owner": "33414236@N03", "id": "4823199168", "title": "555 California Street", "datetaken": "2010-07-19 13:20:01", "isfriend": 0, "secret": "23ec5ec273", "ownername": "Scott Hess", "latitude": 0, "accuracy": 0, "isfamily": 0, "description": {"_content": "10-July_9575-72\n<a href=\"http://www.ScottHessPhoto.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.ScottHessPhoto.com</a>\n"}, "tags": "sanfrancisco financialdistrict bankofamerica bankofamericabuilding 555california 555californiastreet", "farm": 5, "width_m": "333", "height_m": "500", "datetakenunknown": 0, "datetakengranularity": "0", "url_s": "https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4134/4823199168_23ec5ec273_m.jpg", "longitude": 0, "server": "4134", "url_m": "https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4134/4823199168_23ec5ec273.jpg", "context": 0, "height_s": "240", "width_s": "160"}, {"ispublic": 1, "place_id": "GddgqTpTUb8LgT93hw", "geo_is_public": 1, "owner": "13875847@N00", "id": "4446607993", "title": "Bank of Light", "woeid": "23512022", "geo_is_friend": 0, "geo_is_contact": 0, "datetaken": "2010-03-19 20:38:48", "isfriend": 0, "secret": "36d38b896b", "ownername": "karlsbad", "latitude": "37.793058", "accuracy": "15", "isfamily": 0, "description": {"_content": "&quot;555 California Street, formerly the Bank of America Center, is a 52-story, 779 ft (237.4 m) skyscraper in San Francisco, California.

Completed in 1969, the tower served as the world headquarters of Bank of America until the 1998 merger with NationsBank, when company moved its headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nA 70 percent interest was acquired by Vornado Realty Trust from foreign investors in March 2007 with a 30 percent limited partnership interest still owned by Donald Trump, while continuing to be managed by the Shorenstein Company.\n\n555 California Street was meant to be a deliberate and unambiguous display of the wealth, power, and importance of Bank of America. To that end, the center was handled by the architecture firms Wurster, Bernardi and Emmons and Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, with architect Pietro Belluschi consulting. The structural engineering was performed by the San Francisco firm H. J. Brunnier Associates.
