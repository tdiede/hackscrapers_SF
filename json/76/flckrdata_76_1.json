The base has three segmental arched openings with decorative metal sash frames and fruit garland moldings above. The central entry has ornate ionic engaged columns; the corner piers have a lion head motif. The shaft is articulated by rusticated piers and three recessed bays. The spandrels are decorated with incised metal panels. The shaft is terminated by large keystones above window frames and by vertical foliated relief on the corner piers. The upper transitional story contains a large central medallion with a woman's head and the garland motif seen on the base. The capital consists of five stories of setbacks capped by an ornate dome. Under construction during the '06 quake and fire, the structure was completely destroyed and had to be rebuilt. It was one of the first local buildings braced with lattice girders. <b>The building was designed in anticipation of large-scale adjacent construction which would hide the rear slab and leave only a narrow street front exposed.</b> The interior was altered in 1920 by Smith O'Brien: a stone vestibule leads into a classical marble banking room: Ionic square columns and clerestory windows separate the public and private working areas. The coffered ceiling is alternated with modern lighting panels. Intricate moldings frame ceiling panels and clerestory area. Terra cotta by the Steiger Terra Cotta &amp; Pottery Works. Interior remodeled 1920 by Smith O'Brien, who added bronze, marble &amp; ornamental plaster.\n"}, "tags": "sanfrancisco california tower marketstreet humboldtbankbuilding frederickhmeyer", "farm": 8, "width_m": "261", "height_m": "500", "datetakenunknown": "1", "datetakengranularity": 0, "url_s": "https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7498/15710214727_c0df4698ea_m.jpg", "longitude": 0, "server": "7498", "url_m": "https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7498/15710214727_c0df4698ea.jpg", "context": 0, "height_s": "240", "width_s": "125"}, {"ispublic": 1, "place_id": "ZeiqPCRTWrho47lm2A", "geo_is_public": 1, "owner": "57453294@N00", "id": "14814166318", "title": "Humboldt Savings Bank", "woeid": "28288711", "geo_is_friend": 0, "geo_is_contact": 0, "datetaken": "2014-08-21 20:06:33", "isfriend": 0, "secret": "fef48064b0", "ownername": "sftrajan", "latitude": "37.786744", "accuracy": "16", "isfamily": 0, "description": {"_content": "In 1905, the President and Directors of the Humboldt Savings Bank embarked on plans to build an elegant high-rise tower at 785 Market Street and Fourth Street.
