Within three years it had been replaced by an electric telegraph station, which itself soon fell out of use, though the 'Telegraph Hill' name stuck.  The site was purchased by local businessmen in 1876 specifically to prevent further development; they donated the land to the city on condition that it became a park.  Aside from being an obvious choice for the location of the 64m-tall Lillian Coit Memorial Tower, opened in 1933, Pioneer Park is also known for its resident wild parrots.\n\nNeedless to say, the buildings of the Financial District were somewhat smaller in 1850; the 'Manhattanization' of San Francisco didn't occur until the 1960s and 70s.  The skyline features four successively holders of the record for 'tallest building in California' (and hence tallest west of west of the Mississippi) 1964-74: at 142 m, the Hartford Building at 650 California St. was tallest when built in 1964, but surrendered the title to the 172 m 44 Montgomery (once the world headquarters for Wells Fargo Bank) on its completion in 1967.  555 California Street, still the second tallest building in the city and largest by floor area, reached 237 m in 1969, but was overtaken by the dramatic 260 m Transamerica Pyramid in 1972. That in turn is now 'merely' the tallest in the city and in the top 200 worldwide.\nThe city's third tallest, incidentally, is the twin-towered 345 California Center, 189 m tall to roof level but 220 m if the spires are included."}, "tags": "sanfrancisco california ca usa building tower skyscraper observation bay memorial yacht landmark financialdistrict coittower fishermanswharf artdeco telegraphhill pier39 viewpoint hartford coit lillian transamericapyramid pioneerpark citigroupcenter embarcaderocenter shakleeterraces onefrontstreet onesansomestreet 44montgomery lilliehitchcockcoit 345californiacenter 650california 555montgomerystreet postmontgomerycenter", "farm": 6, "geo_is_family": 0, "width_m": "500", "height_m": "333", "datetakenunknown": 0, "datetakengranularity": "0", "url_s": "https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5483/14357512814_c62d3718f8_m.jpg", "longitude": "-122.412077", "server": "5483", "url_m": "https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5483/14357512814_c62d3718f8.jpg", "context": 0, "height_s": "160", "width_s": "240"}, {"ispublic": 1, "owner": "18343779@N00", "id": "4370850165", "title": "One Sansome Street View", "datetaken": "2010-02-19 11:53:33", "isfriend": 0, "secret": "37d6205807", "ownername": "RevellRay", "latitude": 0, "accuracy": 0, "isfamily": 0, "description": {"_content": "50/365\n\nToday I had a pretty cool gig shooting a corporate portrait for a senior VP of a major bank here in the city.
