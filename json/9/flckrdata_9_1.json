The foreground comprises residential streets of three-storey houses with the characteristic San Francisco bay windows (themselves reminiscent of British 20th Century suburban architecture), blending into a narrow band of two-storey office buildings.  Then, as abruptly as crossing Washington Street, there rises a wall of high-rise towers including the 48-storey Transamerica Pyramid.\n\nDesigned by William Pereira &amp; Associates and built 1969-72 for the Transamerica Corporation, the distinctive 260m-tall Transamerica Pyramid was once ranked amongst the world's five tallest buildings; it's now 'merely' the tallest in San Francisco, clearly visible from across the region. It was nearly the world's second tallest, at 305 m (1,000 feet), but the City's Planning Commission was concerned about the view from Nob Hill, off the right of the image.  Planning concerns also inspired its tapered shape, which reduces the building's apparent shadow and allows more light to penetrate to street level.  The 'wings' rising from the 29th floor accommodate unavoidably vertical elements of the building: two elevator shafts on the east, and a stairwell and a smoke tower on the west.\n\nTo the immediate right of the Pyramid is Montgomery Street, the original heart of the Financial District and &quot;the Wall Street of the West&quot;.  As recently as 1830 it was the waterfront, at which ships were able to moor; everything to the left is reclaimed land.  Needless to say, the buildings of the Financial District were somewhat smaller in the 19th Century; the 'Manhattanization' of San Francisco didn't occur until the 1960s and 70s.\n\n<strong>[Image features several notes]</strong>"}, "tags": "sanfrancisco california ca street usa building tower skyscraper one front financialdistrict coittower montgomery telegraphhill 500 viewpoint 44 transamericapyramid 505 456 pioneerpark 444 citigroupcenter embarcaderocenter shakleeterraces sansome 101californiastreet bankofitaly lilliehitchcockcoit 345californiacenter transamericaredwoodpark 50fremontcenter 100pinecenter montgomerywashingtontower", "farm": 3, "geo_is_family": 0, "width_m": "333", "height_m": "500", "datetakenunknown": 0, "datetakengranularity": "0", "url_s": "https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2909/14271317549_d35fc92595_m.jpg", "longitude": "-122.405830", "server": "2909", "url_m": "https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2909/14271317549_d35fc92595.jpg", "context": 0, "height_s": "240", "width_s": "160"}, {"ispublic": 1, "place_id": "GddgqTpTUb8LgT93hw", "geo_is_public": 1, "owner": "57453294@N00", "id": "7869137156", "title": "", "woeid": "23512022", "geo_is_friend": 0, "geo_is_contact": 0, "datetaken": "2012-08-25 18:17:59", "isfriend": 0, "secret": "50ba1705a7", "ownername": "sftrajan", "latitude": "37.790285", "accuracy": "16", "isfamily": 0, "description": {"_content": "(L) 50 Fremont Center (1985)\n(R) Millenium Tower\nSan francisco\n\nPhotos no longer obstructed by the Transbay Terminal, which has been demolished.\n\n\nAugust 2012.\n\n2012.08.25 013"}, "tags": "sanfrancisco downtown missionstreet millenniumtower 50fremontcenter", "farm": 8, "geo_is_family": 0, "width_m": "375", "height_m": "500", "datetakenunknown": 0, "datetakengranularity": "0", "url_s": "https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7267/7869137156_50ba1705a7_m.jpg", "longitude": "-122.396643", "server": "7267", "url_m": "https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7267/7869137156_50ba1705a7.jpg", "context": 0, "height_s": "240", "width_s": "180"}, {"ispublic": 1, "place_id": "GddgqTpTUb8LgT93hw", "geo_is_public": 1, "owner": "57453294@N00", "id": "7869982852", "title": "", "woeid": "23512022", "geo_is_friend": 0, "geo_is_contact": 0, "datetaken": "2012-08-25 18:19:30", "isfriend": 0, "secret": "a690a1a3ea", "ownername": "sftrajan", "latitude": "37.790167", "accuracy": "16", "isfamily": 0, "description": {"_content": "San Francisco\n(L) 50 Fremont Center (1985)\n(R) Millenium Tower\n\n\nPhotos no longer obstructed by the Transbay Terminal, which has been demolished.\n\nAugust 2012.\n\n\n2012.08.25 015"}, "tags": "cameraphone sanfrancisco skyscraper buildings edificios southofmarket missionstreet milleniumtower 50fremontcenter lgoptimusslider", "farm": 9, "geo_is_family": 0, "width_m": "375", "height_m": "500", "datetakenunknown": 0, "datetakengranularity": "0", "url_s": "https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8446/7869982852_a690a1a3ea_m.jpg", "longitude": "-122.396643", "server": "8446", "url_m": "https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8446/7869982852_a690a1a3ea.jpg", "context": 0, "height_s": "240", "width_s": "180"}, {"ispublic": 1, "owner": "41699885@N02", "id": "5685640804", "title": "252_0411_36", "datetaken": "2011-05-03 17:15:28", "isfriend": 0, "secret": "3282572a7d", "ownername": "wire_paladinSF", "latitude": 0, "accuracy": 0, "isfamily": 0, "description": {"_content": "open space across transbay terminal site - san francisco 2011"}, "tags": "sanfrancisco california ltm bw film rangefinder 135 rodinal150 iic 2011 legacypro100 50fremontcenter 35skopar25 transbayterminalsite", "farm": 6, "width_m": "290", "height_m": "500", "datetakenunknown": "1", "datetakengranularity": 0, "url_s": "https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5310/5685640804_3282572a7d_m.jpg", "longitude": 0, "server": "5310", "url_m": "https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5310/5685640804_3282572a7d.jpg", "context": 0, "height_s": "240", "width_s": "139"}], "perpage": 500, "page": 1, "pages": 1}, "stat": "ok"}
